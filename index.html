					<p class="viganT">Go back in time when walking down Calle Crisologo streets in Viggan. The 16th-century town, a UNESCO world landscape, boasts quietly Old World charm and Spanish colonial architecture and is the Ilocos tours' top attraction. The city has effectively protected the historic district where calesas can still be found (horse-drawn carriages). Enjoy the popular and tasty empanada Ilocos and stroll down cobblestone roads lined with souvenir shops selling pottery and weaves of Abel Iloko, amongst the many things to see and do in Vigan.

							<p class="mayonT">The most perfect cone in the world and volcano most active in the Philippines welcomes you with its glory as soon as your flight finishes at the airport in Legazpi District. Mayon Volcano is one of the Philippines' most scenic locations and is a top destination for Bicol tours. Its pure beauty, the name mayon, comes from the word "magayon," meaning lovely; in Bicolano, it is the hiding of a violent center. The volcano from afar is now a magnificent experience. But you can soak up its charm as you float down a zipline at Lignon Hill if you are an adrenaline junkie. More insight on the Mayon Volcano is the Cagsawa Ruins. On your ride to Legazpi, go to Donsol, where you can see whale sharks settling in their natural habitat peacefully.

							<p class="taalT">Manila residents and tourists will take a short break from the megacities to Tagaytay, a resort and leisure city known for the cool weather and the fresh air. In Batangas, the smallest active volcano in the country, you can take a complete view of the Taal and the bay. The volcano sits on a lake within the island. You can visit the present volcano crater by hiking around the Taal Volcano if that is not exciting enough. A bottom-up boat takes you to Volcanic Island for the first time, and you can stroll for around 35 minutes or ride horseback to the main crater from there. During your ride to Tagaytay and Batangas, be sure to heat up with a tasty Bulalo mug, a transparent broth with shanks, bone marrow, and maize floating in its golden glory.

							<p class="coronT">Kayangan Lake in Coron, Palawan, is certainly one of the Philippines' most photographed and popular attractions. Its lagoon is a sunny, sunny day blend of blues and greens. Kayangan Lake excursions lead you to the tiny calcareous rims and islets, linking it to a more mystical view better viewed from the 10-mins climb up a hill. This view of the new Kayangan Lake isn't funnily enough, but rather the place where tour boats dock, although it is still amazing. As stunning as the views from above are beneath the glassy waters of the present pool. There are plenty of rock formations and fish schools that make the area a popular location for many tourists to snorkel and swim. The island destinations and many other significant Coron adventures that could be to attempt are renowned also for island-hopping trips and diving in their many sheltering destinations.

								<p class="camiguinT">Island - With just 23 x 14 km in size, it is the second smallest populated island in the Philippines. The beaches, waterfalls, and seven volcanoes are stunning! Go for a swim, snorkel, or dive at Mantigue Island, or go for a swim at the falls of Katibawasan or Tuawasan. Trek one of the volcanoes and go up Mt. Timpoong, which is around 1,600 meters high if you are up against a challenge! Visit the old city with Spanish temples, remnants of old cities, and Spanish and American homes.

										<p class="ifugaoT">The Banaue Rice Terraces, situated in the Banaue of Ifugao, North Luzón, is an excellent destination and is one of the Philippines' most magnificent spots some 2000 years ago.Just sit down on the top of the vibrant jeepney and enjoy the view of the dramatic rice terrace surrounded by mud along winding roads in Banaue.The people of Ifugao were exceptionally skilled in wood and mountain carving. The Banaue Rice Terraces is a UNESCO world patrimony and provides splendid emerald color views during the April-May-October-November rice growing seasons. Banaue will pack many visitors to take a swift wind in its mighty Tappiya waterfalls and carry on to the quieter Batad Rice Terraces. The neighboring Baguio City or La Trinidad, Benguet, are also available for picking fresh strawberries.

										<center><h1 class="siargaoH">Cloud 9, Siargao</h1></center>
										<p class="siargaoT">Siargao is nothing short of meteoric, being listed among the main tourist destinations in the Philippines. Formerly a quiet island in the north of Surigao, it has become one of the most popular tourist attractions and playgrounds and is largely attributed to one activity: surfing. It is now recognized as the Philippines' surfing capital. Some also consider it as Asia's surf mecca. Surfers come to Cloud 9, the country's most popular wave. From November to April, all is good with the dense Cloud 9 cables, making it ideal for storage (note: it is recommended for advanced surfers only). But you do not need to be riding the waves to enjoy this island destination as there are also other fun Siargao activities and beautiful attractions like rock pools, waterfalls, and the nearby Sohoton Lagoon where you can swim with thousands of non-sting jellyfish.

										<p class="boracayT">Boracay's claim to fame is its 4 km strip of white pure and powdery sand dubbed "white beach," long celebrated as one of the best beaches in the entire world.Cliche as it seems, but White Beach is always a dream postcard, with tall cocoa trees lined up and crystal clear calm water complementing Boracay tours with their unparalleled appeal.In recent decades, its prominence has brought in an influx of visitors, and hotels, restaurants, and bars across the island are not missing.As the sunsets come to an end, this small island with its busy nightlife gathers the notoriety of being a party destination where you can even take bar crawl tours.Other areas such as Puka Beach and Diniwid Beach provide a nice rest and a soothing experience throughout the day. Other wonderful activities in Boracay include tours on the White Beach and activities such as parasailing, helmet diving, banana boats, and paraglider.
